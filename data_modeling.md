To fulfill the requirements for Brikl platform, we can create the following Python classes:

Storefront:

Properties:
storefront_id (unique identifier for each storefront)
user_id (unique identifier for the user who owns the storefront)
name (name of the storefront)
description (description of the storefront)
Methods:
display_promotional_products(): a method that displays only the promotional products for the storefront.
display_catalog(): a method that displays the catalogs of products available in the storefront.
MicroStore:

Properties:
microstore_id (unique identifier for each microstore)
user_id (unique identifier for the user who owns the microstore)
name (name of the microstore)
description (description of the microstore)
Methods:
display_products(): a method that displays all the products available in the microstore.
Product:

Properties:
product_id (unique identifier for each product)
title (title of the product)
description (description of the product)
price (price of the product)
available_date (date when the product will be available)
stock_quantity (quantity of the product in stock)
product_images (a list of images for the product)
Methods:
get_category(): a method that returns the category of the product.
get_availability(): a method that returns the availability status of the product (in-stock or out-of-stock).
Catalog:

Properties:
catalog_id (unique identifier for each catalog)

These classes can be used to represent the data in the Brikl platform and can be extended as needed.
